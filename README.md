# MScThesis
The codes and other supplementary documents for my M.Sc. thesis. 

Folders:

Fieldtrip - This folder includes different analyses we conducted using Fieldtrip. It uses EEGLab until preprocessing (with the script acquired from Debora Nolte) the data for the Fieldtrip. This part of the thesis was done together with Eva-Marie von Butler. Together, we have preprocessed the data, separated the data into conditions using trigger files (acquired from Debora Nolte), and analyzed the activity and produced ERSPs for PO channels that were presented at Synapsium 2023, Nijmegne, Netherlands, together with Eva-Marie von Butler. This folder includes the NGK script which was used to create spectrograms for the conference, Ankara, Turkey. These spectrograms report Oz activity decomposed with 1-, 3-, and 5-cycle Morlet wavelets. 
The folder lastly includes the scripts that were written for the TFCE on Fieldtrip, which were failed. 

MNE - Includes one script which takes the data transformed into MNE from Fieldtrip. These data are from each subject in each condition. We use these data to apply time, time-frequency and statistical analyses using MNE. 

Figures - Figurecreation includes the notebook where I used code generated from ChatGPT but tweaked by me to use in my plots. Results-Plots include the result figures. diagram_mne folder includes the foguredev.key file which I worked on my plots to create some diagrams. 

And, MscThesis_PelinKomurluoglu.pdf is the submission.
